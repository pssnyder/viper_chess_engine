# chess_game.yaml
# Configuration for the automated game handler
# This is where pygame chess game settings are configured, as well as the white and black engine paths to use for the game. Additional configurations for those engines will be in engine_utilities/external_engines/<engine_name>_handler.yaml

# game_config settings
game_config:

  # General game settings

  game_clock: 0 #300             # Time in seconds for each player, 0 for no clock
  game_increment: 0 #2           # Increment in seconds per move, 0 for no increment
  rated: true                    # Set to true to record game and move metrics for analysis.

  # AI vs AI game_config settings
  ai_vs_ai: true                 # Set to true for AI vs AI matches
  ai_game_count: 10000           # Number of games to play in AI vs AI mode
  starting_position: default     # Default starting position name (or FEN string)
  strict_draw_prevention: true   # Enforce strict draw rules to fully block drawing moves that would lead to stalemate, insufficient material, and threefold repetition
  
  # AI vs Human game_config settings
  human_color: random            # Options: white, black, random (for human vs AI)
  human_elo: 100                # Elo rating for human player, used for AI vs Human games to adapt Engine to human skill level               

# Engine configurations
# These configurations are for the AI engines used in the game, such as Viper and Stockfish.
white_ai_config:
  exclude_from_metrics: false   # TODO Implement flag to exclude this engines performance from metrics collection, useful for testing, non-competitive, or third party AIs who's performance you may not want to record for this set of games, should flag all outputs from this color and engine for this match date_timestamp as being excluded from metrics, these metrics should still be gathered as a fallback, and in the event I do want to use them so we just want to have a flag in the database for exclude from metrics. Then I can always toggle the flags per game record in the database if I want to see a game or vice versa.

  engine: viper_opponent             # sets this colors engine type, same as above, important note that if the engines are set the same then only whites metrics will be collected to prevent negation in win loss metrics
