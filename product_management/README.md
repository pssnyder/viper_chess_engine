# Viper Chess Engine - Product Management & Administration

Welcome to the Product Management and Administration guide for the Viper Chess Engine. This document outlines the tools, processes, and rules for managing the product lifecycle, backlog, and documentation.

---

## 1. Product Administration & Backlog Management

- **Github Projects**: Used for organizing, prioritizing, and planning major initiatives, enhancements, and bug fixes. Projects reflect the product roadmap and vision.
- **Github Issues**: Used for detailed work tracking and allocation. All work items should be linked to a project and have a clear problem statement.
- **Project Plan**: Before starting any significant work, a project plan should be created and saved in the `product_management` directory. This plan must be approved by the Product Manager.

**Copilot Guidance**:  
Copilot should use this README as a reference for assisting with idea intake, categorization, and prioritization. All actions must align with the processes described here.

---

## 2. Product Requirements & Scope Adherence

- **STRICT Adherence (Current)**:  
  - All significant changes must be verified with the Product Manager before implementation.
  - Large or risky changes require a detailed project plan and explicit approval.
  - Copilot should ask clarifying questions before proceeding with any work that could impact production readiness.

- **Other Adherence Levels**:
  - **DEFAULT**: Copilot may proceed with reasonable autonomy but should verify requirements if uncertain.
  - **NO-LIMIT**: Copilot has creative freedom; no strict deadlines or launch dependencies.

**Current Setting:**  
`STRICT` – Please check with the Product Manager before making any code changes that could introduce dependencies or risks.

## 3. Product Documentation & Tools

- **Todo Tree (VSCode Extension)**:  
  - Enables tracking of TODO and FIXME comments in code.
  - These tags are integrated into the product management workflow, allowing Copilot to suggest issues based on code annotations.
  - More info: [Todo Tree GitHub](https://github.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree)
